# Project Title 
Concrete_Compressive_Strength_Prediction

# Description
The aim here is to predict the compressive strength of concrete using mix parameters. Credits - Tensorflow tutorial Basic regression: Predict fuel efficiency - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression
This notebook uses the Concrete Compressive Strength Data dataset available at - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/concrete+compressive+strength. This notebook uses the Keras API.
